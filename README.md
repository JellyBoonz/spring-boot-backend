This application powers a complete implemented backend for the eCommerce project TrÃ©bol.

## Features:
* A [REST API designed accordingly to the OpenAPI 3 standard](https://github.com/trebol-ecommerce/trebol-api).
* Compatibility with any JDBC driver. By default comes with H2 and MariaDB drivers. 
* Supports managing information about billing/shipping addresses, customers, products, images, categories, sales, salespeople, shippers.
* Supports stateless sessions through JWTs authorization. 
* Authentication is done through a database table of application users. Passwords are encoded using BCrypt.
* Supports registering for new user accounts.
* Currently only allows payment using Webpay Plus (service that accepts chilean credit and debit cards).
* And all other Spring Boot goodness!

## Roadmap
See the issues section.

## Requirements

* JDK 11+
* Apache Maven 3.6.0

## Configuration & Execution

Base settings are set in the default configuration profile, which is located 
at `/src/main/resources/application.properties`.
You can "just" run the application out-of-the-box with these, though you'll 
probably want to change the database driver and URL, between other things.
The aforementioned file also has instructions to set things up and running, so 
go ahead and read it if you're curious.
